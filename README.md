# Cut The Cutlery

In **10bis** orders the `ללא סכו"ם חד פעמי` checkbox is disabled by default  
**CutTheCutlery** will auto check "no plastic cutlery" for you on the checkout stage

In **Cibus** orders the the `עם סכו"ם חד פעמי` checkbox is disabled by default, but we can still help!  
**CutTheCutlery** will auto write "❌🍴 Please no plastic cutlery 🍴❌" in the notes to restaurant textbox
